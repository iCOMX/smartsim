# SmartSim: A Device Accurate Smart Home Simulator for Energy Analytics

[Introduction]

Smart_Home_Sim is a simulator that could be used to generate the home energy usuage traces even without the installation of smart meters in buildings. These energy data is generated bashed on the study of modeling and usage pattern of different real appliances at homes. Smart_Home_Sim can not only generate energy usage traces customized by users but also provide the ready-to-use HDF5 file of the traces for NILMTK (Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring Toolkit).
